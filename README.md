# A repository with attempts at coding challenges

The challenges are taken from [infoarena](https://infoarena.ro/). An attempt is a
source file that can be uploaded. Since there are multiple challenges and each can
have attempts written in multiple languages the folder structure is the following:
`[CHALLENGE]/[ATTEMPT_LANGUAGE]/`.

For example the attempts for the challenge `https://infoarena.ro/problema/euclid2`
will reside in `euclid2/` and an attempt written in **C++** will reside in `euclid2/cpp`.

## Tips (for me in the future)

- Include a comment at the top of each attempt with the URL of the challenge.
 (for easy navigation)
